# FabFem Skincare!
The objective/approach of this project was to create a full-stack application. The main focus of this application is to provide a step-by-step breakdown of at-home skincare routines mainly applicable to women who wear makeup.

## List of Features
* Users click "FabFem Skincare!" link to access the full application.

* Users are able to click "Proper Makeup Removal", "Cleansing" and/or "After Cleanse Treatment" to read skincare routines that have already been added to the application.

* Beneath the already available routine links ("Proper Makeup Removal", "Cleansing" and "After Cleanse Treatment") users are then able to create additional skincare routines by completing and submitting the "Create New Routine" form. 

* Once one of the already created routine links are clicked, the user is then taken to a page which displays the complete instructions corresponding to that particular routine. They are also able to update or remove this specific routine from this area of the application. 

* To view all of the active routines within the application, users are able to click the "Routines" button on the nav bar.

* to return the initial landing page of the application, users are able to click the "Home" button on the nav bar.

## Reflection
* I decided to do this type of project, because I wear makeup on a daily basis, which can cause skin issues if a proper skincare routine isn't adhered to.
* Ultimately, I plan on adding additional features to this application which will categorize the skincare routines based on skin types (i.e., oily, normal, combination or dry) and skin conditions (i.e., sensitive, vitiligo, eczema, rosacea etc.)
* Routing and the Heroku deployment were the most difficult of this project
* Some of the unexpected obstacles that I faced during this project are, even though I added a Procfile and included the necessary information, I was still unable to deploy my app to Heroku because Heroku bypassed the Procfile and required a key value of "start" in the package.json. I also had to change the way in which each routine displayed on the app in order to simplify the routing issues I was experiencing.
