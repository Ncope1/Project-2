# Grading

**10/15**
Awesome work! Your skincare routine app is fully functioning and meets all of the requirements for project 2. Your code is especially well organized and easy to read. Your readme and planning directory show that you approached the project thoughfully and self identify areas for improvement in the future. Keep up the great work!

### Technical Requirements: Performing (2)

* Functioning model with full CRUD functionality!
* App is successfully deployed on heroku

### Creativity/Interface: Progressing (1)

* App has basic styling that shows thoughtful choice about color and layout
* App has an easy to navigate interface

### Code Quality: Excelling (3)

* Code is well organized and shows separation of concerns.

### Functionality: Performing (2)

* Application functions well with no bugs or errors

### Planning/Precess/Submission: Performing (2)

* Repo includes a great readme with instructions on how to use, description of features, list of resources and technologies used, and features to be added in the future
* Repo includes a planning directory with ERD and written description of process and planning
* Good use of frequent commits to track changes

### Additional notes:

* styling suggestions (these are only suggestions and they are subjective to my personal taste):
  * Your background image is nice and sets the tone for your site. However be mindful when choosing images and font colors. Using a photo with both dark and light areas can make it difficult to see text on all parts of the image. The purple text is difficult to read in some areas.
    * Consider adding another solid background behind some of your page elements to separate the text from the background image.
  * Some margin on the sides of your page would help the content stand out. White or empty space is really important for making a design feel light and natural.
  * The form on your routines page doesn't need to extend the whole width.
    * Consider adding a second column to your layout to visually separate your form from the list of routines.
  * Green and purple are nice color compliments, however less is sometimes more. With such a colorful background, adding some white or very light sections to the page will lighten the feeling of the page.
    * Consider using more black text, reserving the bold purple for headers or sections you want to emphasize.
